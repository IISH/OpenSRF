OpenSRF 3.2.0
-------------
OpenSRF 3.2.0 was released on 2 October 2019. This release adds
support for Debian 10 Buster and deprecates the Apache `mod_websocket`
backend for the WebSockets gateway but does not add new features.

Major Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for Debian 10 Buster (LP#1835458)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpenSRF 3.2 adds support for Debian 10 Buster. Debian 10 comes with
ejabberd 18.12 (as compared to ejabberd 16.09 in Debian 9), which
means that a `mod_legacy_auth` directive will need to be uncommented
or added to the ejabberd configuration. However, Debian 10 is
otherwise not significantly different from Debian 9 as far as OpenSRF
is concerned.

Removal of Support for `mod_websocket` (LP#1834208)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OpenSRF 3.2 formally removes support for using the Apache
`mod_websocket` module to act as the WebSockets gateway to OpenSRF
in favor of requiring `websocketed`. OpenSRF 3.2 also includes tweaks
to the example NGINX and HAProxy configurations.

Folks upgrading from previous versions of OpenSRF who are using
`mod_websocket` should follow the instructions for installing
`websocketd`, then stop remove the `apache2-websockets` Apache
instance before starting `websocketd`.

Removal of Variable Arguments for `md5sum()` (LP#1830642)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `md5sum()` utility function included in OpenSRF's C code
no longer accepts variadic arguments, fixing a bug in Evergreen
where a percent in a user password could prevent authentication
from working.

Upgrade Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OpenSRF 3.2 introduces changes to the application binary interface
(ABI) for C applications. Consequently, Evergreen users should plan on
recompiling Evergreen after installing OpenSRF 3.2.

Users of NGINX or HAProxy should review the example configuration files
(respectively `examples/nginx/osrf-ws-http-proxy`
or `examples/haproxy/osrf-ws-http-proxy`) and make adjustments to
their production configuration accordingly.

Evergreen Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OpenSRF 3.2 can be used by Evergreen 3.1.x, 3.2.x, 3.3.x, and 3.4.x.
